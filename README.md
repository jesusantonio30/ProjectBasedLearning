# ProjectBasedLearning

This repository serves as a personal space for hands-on learning through practical projects. The primary purpose is to deepen my understanding of computer science concepts by implementing them in code, rather than relying solely on theoretical study.

## Repository Purpose

- **Learning by Doing**: Each project is designed to reinforce fundamental and advanced topics through active development.
- **Structured Skill Development**: Projects are organized to build progressively, starting with core concepts and advancing to more complex implementations.

## Current Focus

My current emphasis is on mastering essential fundamentals in **networks** and **systems programming**, with a strong foundation in **C++**.

### Ongoing Project
- Building a **TCP Echo Server** to understand fundamental socket programming concepts.
- Implementing connection acceptance to handle incoming client requests.
- Gaining hands-on experience with network programming basics and server-client interaction.

## Future Plans

Future projects will expand into:
- Low-level system interactions (e.g., memory management, processes, threads)
- Network programming (e.g., sockets, protocols)
- Performance optimization and systems architecture

This repository reflects my ongoing journey in systems-level programming. Contributions are not expected, as it is primarily a personal learning log, but feedback is always welcome.

Thank you for visiting!
